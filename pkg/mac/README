Building pgAdmin4.dmg on Mac OS X
=================================

Required Packages (Either build the sources or get them from macports or
similar):

1. Python installation
  - Python 3.4+ or above from https://www.python.org/

2. QT installation
  - Qt 5 from http://www.qt.io/

3. PostgreSQL installation
  - PostgreSQL 9.5 or above from http://www.postgresql.org/

Building:

1. Set the PYTHON_HOME environment variable to the Python root installation
   directory, e.g.

   export PYTHON_HOME=/opt/local

2. Set the QTDIR environment variable to the QT root installation directory,
   e.g.

   export QTDIR=~/Qt/5.14.2/clang_64

3. Set the PGDIR environment variable to the PostgreSQL installation directory,
   e.g.

   export PGDIR=/usr/local/pgsql

4. Copy framework.conf.in to framework.conf, and edit the values accordingly.

5. If you want to codesign the appbundle, copy codesign.conf.in to
   codesign.conf and set the values accordingly.

6. To build, go to pgAdmin4 source root directory and execute "make appbundle".
   This will create the python virtual environment and install all the required
   python modules mentioned in the requirements file using pip, build the
   runtime code and finally create the app bundle and the DMG in ./dist
   directory.
