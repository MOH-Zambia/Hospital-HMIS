This directory contains the build runner script for creating .RPM packages for
Redhat distributions. 

Build configuration
===================

To build RPM packages, first run the setup.sh script as root to install the 
required pre-requisites, e.g.

    # pkg/redhat/setup.sh

Building packages
=================

To build a set of packages, from the top-level source directory run:

    $ make redhat

or

    $ pkg/redhat/build.sh

Four .rpm packages will be created in the dist/ directory:

pgadmin4-<version>.<distro>_noarch.rpm
  A convenience package that depends on all the others.

pgadmin4-server-<version>.<distro>.<arch>.rpm
  The core server, e.g. the Python and JS code and the online documentation.

pgadmin4-desktop-<version>.<distro>.<arch>.rpm
  The desktop runtime. Requires the server package.

pgadmin4-web-<version>.<distro>.<arch>.rpm
  The server mode setup script for configuring Apache HTTPD. Requires the 
  server package.

pgadmin4-python3-mod_wsgi-4.7.1-2.el7.<arch>.rpm
  The Python 3 build of mod_wsgi for the Apache HTTPD server. Only built
  on RHEL/CentOS 7.

Supported platforms
===================

Fedora 30 & 31
RHEL/CentOS 7 & 8
