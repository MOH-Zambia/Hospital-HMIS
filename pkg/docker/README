This directory contains the files required to create a docker container running
pgAdmin.

Building
========

From the top level directory of the pgAdmin source tree, simply run:

docker build .

You can also run 'make docker', which will call 'docker build .' but also tag
the image like:

pgadmin4 pgadmin4:latest pgadmin4:4 pgadmin4:4.12

WARNING: The build should be run in a CLEAN source tree. Whilst some potentially
         dangerous files such as config_local.py or log files will be explicitly
         excluded from the final image, other files will not be.

Running
=======

See the documentation at docs/en_US/container_deployment.rst for information on
running the container.
